   :note "Translated from the Museum Blaubeuren site: “The statuette is 40,000 years old and was carved from a mammoth tusk. It broke apart over time in the ground. Six fragments were pieced together to form an almost complete figure. Instead of a head, there is a loop in the neck area. The female figure was once worn as an amulet or piece of jewelry.”" ;
